metadata:
  name: task-git-cli
spec:
  description: |
    pull-revision takes a git script and a commit SHA
    and validates that the task returns a correct commit SHA. This is an example
    Pipeline demonstrating the following:
      - Using the git-cli catalog Task that execute a script to pull a repository
      - Passing a pulled repo to subsequent Tasks using a Workspace.
      - Ordering Tasks in a Pipeline using "runAfter" so that
        git-cli completes before we try to read from the Workspace.
      - Using a volumeClaimTemplate Volume as a Workspace.
      - Avoiding hard-coded paths by using a Workspace's path
        variable instead.
